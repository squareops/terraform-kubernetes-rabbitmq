<br>
This Terraform module allows you to deploy a RabbitMQ message broker on a Kubernetes cluster. It uses the [official RabbitMQ](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/rabbitmq) Helm chart to create a scalable, highly-available RabbitMQ cluster.

The module provides a simple way to configure and deploy RabbitMQ on Kubernetes, including the ability to:

  1. Customize the name and environment of the RabbitMQ deployment
  2. Specify the number of replicas in the cluster
  3. Set up persistent storage using a specific storage class and volume size
  4. Deploy a RabbitMQ exporter to collect metrics for Grafana
  5. Control whether or not to create the Kubernetes namespace for the deployment

The module also includes sensible defaults for all configuration options, making it easy to get up and running with RabbitMQ on Kubernetes quickly.

  ## Supported Versions:

|  Rabbitmq Helm Chart Version    |     K8s supported version (EKS, AKS & GCP)   |  
| :-----:                       |         :---                |
| **14.4.6**                     |    **1.23,1.24,1.25,1.26,1.27,1.28,1.29**           |


## Usage Example

```hcl
locals {
  name        = "rabbitmq"
  region      = ""
  environment = "prod"
  additional_tags = {
    Owner      = "organization_name"
    Expires    = "Never"
    Department = "Engineering"
  }
  create_namespace                 = true
  namespace                        = "rabbitmq"
  store_password_to_secret_manager = false
  custom_credentials_enabled       = false
  custom_credentials_config = {
    rabbitmq_password     = "aa0z1IoRjOgRuon3aG",
    erlangcookie_password = "bbddff0z1IoRuon3aG"
  }
}

module "aws" {
  source                           = "squareops/rabbitmq/kubernetes//modules/resources/aws"
  environment                      = local.environment
  name                             = local.name
  store_password_to_secret_manager = local.store_password_to_secret_manager
  custom_credentials_enabled       = local.custom_credentials_enabled
  custom_credentials_config        = local.custom_credentials_config
}

module "rabbitmq" {
  source           = "squareops/rabbitmq/kubernetes"
  version          = "2.1.1"
  create_namespace = local.create_namespace
  namespace        = local.namespace
  rabbitmq_config = {
    name                             = local.name
    hostname                         = "rabbitmq.squareops.in"
    environment                      = local.environment
    values_yaml                      = file("./helm/values.yaml")
    volume_size                      = "50Gi"
    replica_count                    = 2
    storage_class_name               = "infra-service-sc"
    store_password_to_secret_manager = local.store_password_to_secret_manager
  }
  rabbitmq_exporter_enabled  = true
  recovery_window_aws_secret = 0
  custom_credentials_enabled = local.custom_credentials_enabled
  custom_credentials_config  = local.custom_credentials_config
  rabbitmq_password          = local.custom_credentials_enabled ? "" : module.aws.rabbitmq_password
  erlangcookie_password      = local.custom_credentials_enabled ? "" : module.aws.erlangcookie_password
}

## IAM Permissions
The required IAM permissions to create resources from this module can be found [here](https://github.com/sq-ia/terraform-kubernetes-rabbitmq/blob/main/IAM.md)

## Important Notes
  1. In order to enable the exporter, it is required to deploy Prometheus/Grafana first.
  2. The exporter is a tool that extracts metrics data from an application or system and makes it available to be scraped by Prometheus.
  3. Prometheus is a monitoring system that collects metrics data from various sources, including exporters, and stores it in a time-series database.
  4. Grafana is a data visualization and dashboard tool that works with Prometheus and other data sources to display the collected metrics in a user-friendly way.
  5. To deploy Prometheus/Grafana, please follow the installation instructions for each tool in their respective documentation.
  6. Once Prometheus and Grafana are deployed, the exporter can be configured to scrape metrics data from your application or system and send it to Prometheus.
  7. Finally, you can use Grafana to create custom dashboards and visualize the metrics data collected by Prometheus.
  8. This module is compatible with EKS, AKS & GKE which is great news for users deploying the module on an AWS, Azure & GCP cloud. Review the module's documentation, meet specific configuration requirements, and test thoroughly after deployment to ensure everything works as expected.
